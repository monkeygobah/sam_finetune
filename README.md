# Fine-Tuning SAM for Oculoplastic Segmentation

## Overview
This repository contains code for fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM) specifically for oculoplastic segmentation. The project leverages bounding boxes generated by MediaPipe and employs a novel augmentation technique to improve model performance.

## Key Features
1. **Fine-Tuning SAM for Oculoplastic Segmentation**:
   - Adaptation of SAM to segment oculoplastic regions with improved accuracy.

2. **Bounding Boxes Generated by MediaPipe**:
   - Utilization of MediaPipe to generate initial bounding boxes for the segmentation task.

3. **Training Dataset**:
   - Fine-tuning is performed on the open-source Chicago Facial Dataset, which provides a diverse set of facial images.

4. **Novel Augmentation Technique**:
   - Implementation of a unique augmentation method by jittering the bounding boxes to enhance model robustness and generalization.

## NOTE

Work still under progress. Code not ready for use and will be cleaned up with optimal hps.
